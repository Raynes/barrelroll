# BarrelRoll

**This is currently a hello world project...**

I'm kind of sick of logging into 15 different banks/lenders to get a
consolidated view of the status of my finances. Mint.com is heavyweight, has a
crapton of ads, etc.

BarrelRoll is meant to be a desktop dashboard for your finances.

## Why?

Mostly to learn atom-shell and ES6.
